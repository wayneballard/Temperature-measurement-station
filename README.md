## Key results

- System performs cyclic, synchronous measurement of process value (controlled variable) with
constant sample time.
- System allows for process control in safe range of process value.
- System ensures steady-state error at 5% of the control range
- System allows to set a reference value (set-point) with serial port
- System allows reading current values of: measurement, reference and control signals with serial
port
